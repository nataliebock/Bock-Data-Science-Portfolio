# Machine Learning Streamlit App 

## üìï Project Overview 
- This interactive Streamlit app allows users to use 3 different models (decision trees, linear regression and logistic regression) to evaluate data. 3 sample datasets are loaded, but users also have the option to upload their own dataset as a CSV. Users can view various metrics including F1 scores, RMSE and R squared scores, Gini index and entropy, depending on what model is selected. 
- **Project Goal:** Demonstrate the ability to create an interactive Streamlit app that showcases the pros and cons of different machine learning models for evaluation and prediction. 
- **Skills and Packages Applied:** Python, Streamlit, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit Learn, Graphviz, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and Linear Regression

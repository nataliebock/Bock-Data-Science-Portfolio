# This is a basic Streamlit app that reads data and has interactive widgets in Streamlit.
## 📕 Project Overview: 
**In this introductory Streamlit app, you can look at penguins based on their species, island location, body mass, and flipper length by interacting with various widgets**
- The Streamlit widgets used are: a simple button with text display, select boxes to view based on species and island, and a slider to look at penguins based on flipper length and body mass.

## 📖 Instructions 


**1.** Import the Pandas and Streamlit libraries using the code below: 
````
import pandas as pd
import streamlit as st

````

**2.** Run Streamlit in your terminal and open the prompted link to view the app. For more detailed instructions on this setup, click [here](https://docs.kanaries.net/topics/Streamlit/streamlit-vscode)


**3.** Once these steps are completed, you will be able to run the code in your own VS code environment! 

**Note:** In order to use this Streamlit app, the Python file must be downloaded and Streamlit must be used to create personal url. 

## 📲 App Features
- **Button:** A simple button in Streamlit to click to emphasize excitement for using the app
- **Species Selection:** Allows the user to select different species of penguins to study
- **Sliders:** Allow the user to subset the penguin species based on mass, flipper and bill length
  
## About the Data
- This app uses a Seaborn dataset about different penguin species, where users can look at features like weight, flipper and bill length, and island of residence.

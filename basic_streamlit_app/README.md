# Penguin Streamlit App

## ðŸ“• Project Overview: 
**This is a basic Streamlit app that reads data and has interactive widgets in Streamlit. In this introductory Streamlit app, you can look at penguins based on their species, island location, body mass, and flipper length by interacting with various widgets**

## ðŸ“– Instructions 


**1.** Import the Pandas and Streamlit libraries using the code below: 
````
import pandas as pd
import streamlit as st
````

**2.** Run Streamlit in your terminal and open the prompted link to view the app. For more detailed instructions on this setup, click [here](https://docs.kanaries.net/topics/Streamlit/streamlit-vscode)


**3.** Once these steps are completed, you will be able to run the code in your own VS code environment! 

**Note:** In order to use this Streamlit app, the Python file must be downloaded and Streamlit must be used to create personal url.

# Unsupervised Machine Learning App 
## Project Overview
This Streamlit app encourages users to interact with different widgets in order to evaluate data with different unsupervised learning techniques (K-means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering and Principal Component Analysis). The app features sample datasets, but also allows the user to upload their own CSV file. Users can use this app for exploratory data analysis, and can evaluate the model performances through different [metrics](#-App-Features).
- **Project goal:** The goal of this project is to demonstrate an improved use of Streamlit, while also showing an understanding of unsupervised machine learning and the pros and cons of the 3 featured models. 
- **Skills:**

## üì≤ App Features  
**The app features 3 model types: K-means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). A brief description of each is provided below, along with details about the hyperparameters and evaluation metrics available in the app.**

### K-means Clustering
- **Purpose:** K-means is a type of clustering that groups observations, the information provided in the rows of datasets, into clusters based on finding the best centroid positions. K-means and clustering generally is helpful for finding patterns and creating groups in the data.
- **Clusters:** Users are shown a sliding scale from 2 to 10 where they can select a number of clusters. Clusters are helpful for finding groups in the data, especially since it is unlabeled, and the model will then determine the best centroids for the selected number of groups. Based on the user's selection, a plot using PCA to reduce the number of dimensions to 2 for easy visualization is then created.
- **Evaluation:** To help the user evaluate what the optimal number of clusters is, visualizations are created showing the silhouette score and elbow method. ***Note*** while the Silhouette score is less subjective, there is no perfect metric, instead multiple metrics should be considered. Especially since unsupervised learning is part of exploratory data analysis, it is important to test different options and see which is best.
  - ***Silhouette Score:*** Evaluates the clustering results, with a ***higher score meaning a better clustering.*** This is accomplished by determining how well each point fits the assigned cluster in comparison to the others, and an average silhouette score of each k (number of clusters) is displayed.
  - ***Elbow Method:*** Evaluates the clustering results by plotting the within-cluster sum of squares and the number of clusters. In this case, the best number of clusters is identified by the ***elbow point***, where the decrease in WCSS flattens, or diminishes.

### Hierarchical Clustering
- **Purpose:** Hierarchical clustering is also a type of clustering. This method is unique in that it creates a hierarchical tree of clusters, where more complicated clustering relationships can be seen. Hierarchical clustering also differs from K-means because there is no fixed k, meaning the data clusters can be of varying sizes. The tree can also be seen ***before*** determining the number of clusters, allowing for more informed analysis.
- **Choices for Dendrogram:** The interactive widgets created for altering the dendrogram are depicted and described below

   - ***Linkage***: Linkage provides different ways to measure clusters before merging. Users are given the option of selecting one of the four linkage types described below:
     - *Complete:* When comparing two clusters, the complete linkage option will look for *maximum distance between two points, one in each cluster. The drawback for complete linkage is a strong influence of outliers since it relies on maximum distances.
     - *Average:* When comparing two clusters, the average linkage option will calculate the average for every pair of points in the clusters.
     - *Single:* When comparing two clusters, the single linkage option will look for minimum distance between two points, one in each cluster. Using single linkage may create a long cluster without clearly defined groups, a drawback that may be solved by using a different type of linkage.
     - *Ward:* When comparing two clusters, the ward linkage option has the goal of minimizing the increase in the total within cluster variance created by the merging of clusters.
       
   - ***Label Selection***: Users can also pick the feature that is used to label the dendrogram.
   - ***Truncation***: Users can choose to truncate the dendrogram, which will group things together at a higher level and create simpler dendrogram.





### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- **Purpose:** PCA is a type of dimensionality reduction unsupervised learning model. Essentially PCA and dimensionality reduction broadly **reduces the number of columns, or features,** with the goal of simplifying the data without losing too much information. If you want to simplify your dimensions, this model will be helpful.

**Scaled vs Unscaled**
- For each model option, the user is given the choice between scaling the data, or leaving the data unscaled. Using unscaled data can make it difficult to compare features measured in different units. By scaling the data, it becomes easier to draw comparisons across the different features. Scaling for all three model types is important, with the reasoning being described in depth in the app.

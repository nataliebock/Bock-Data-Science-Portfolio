# Data Science Portfolio Information üìñ 
This portfolio showcases the assignments and projects created in a data science course at the University of Notre Dame in the Spring 2025 semester. Below, projects and descriptions will be added as they are made throughout the semester. Some upcoming topics and work include: visualization, exploratory data analysis and models. All projects are made using Python. 

## Streamlit Apps:
### [Penguins Data App](https://github.com/nataliebock/Bock-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/basic_streamlit_app) üêß 
- The first Streamlit app I've created looks at data on Penguins. Using the interactive sliders and drop-down menu widgets, the user can learn more about the data set and penguins.
- This project complements my portfolio by showing how I can use Streamlit to create interactive apps with a polished look. While it is a simple app, it is a good introductory project. 

### [Machine Learning App](https://github.com/nataliebock/Bock-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/MLStreamlitApp) ‚öôÔ∏è 
- This Streamlit app allows users to evaluate and make predictions based on data through 3 different machine learning models: decision trees, logistic regression, and linear regression.
- This project complements my portfoliio by demonstrating a more complex use of Streamlit, and the application of multiple machine learning models.
- **Skills & Packages:** Python, Streamlit, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit Learn, Graphviz, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and Linear Regression

## Data Cleaning Projects: 
### [Olympics Tidy Data Project](https://github.com/nataliebock/Bock-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/TidyData-Project) ü•á 
- This project uses the principles of tidy data to clean a dataset containing information about the 2008 Summer Olympics. The cleaned data is then used for analysis and visualization.
- To learn more about the tidy data principles and view the project, click the link above or open the TidyData-Project folder within this repository!
- This project complements my coding portfolio by showcasing how I can apply the principles of tidy data to clean a messy dataset and prepare it for analysis. The project also showcases some visualizations, demonstrating how visualizing data is an important part of understanding and evaluating information.
- **Skills & Packages :** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, data cleaning, and data visualization.

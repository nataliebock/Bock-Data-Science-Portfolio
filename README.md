# Bock-Data-Science-Portfolio
This portfolio showcases the assignments and projects created in a data science course at the University of Notre Dame in the Spring 2025 semester. Below, projects and descriptions will be added as they are made throughout the semester. Some upcoming topics and work include: visualization, exploratory data analysis and models.

## Streamlit App:
### [Penguins Data App](https://github.com/nataliebock/Bock-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/basic_streamlit_app) üêß 
- The first Streamlit app I've created looks at data on Penguins. Using the interactive sliders and drop down menu widgets, the user can learn more about the data set and penguins.

## Visualizations 


## Exploratory Data Analysis 
### [Olympics Tidy Data Project](https://github.com/nataliebock/Bock-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/TidyData-Project) ü•á 
- This project uses the principles of tidy data to clean a dataset containing information about the 2008 Summer Olympics.
- The cleaned data is then used for analysis and visualizations.

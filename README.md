# Data Science Portfolio Information üìñ 
This portfolio showcases the assignments and projects created in a data science course at the University of Notre Dame in the Spring 2025 semester. Below, projects and descriptions made through the course of the semester are presented. Some topics and work include: visualization, tidying data, exploratory data analysis, machine learning models, and Streamlit apps. All projects are made using Python. 

## Streamlit Apps:
### [Penguins Data App](https://github.com/nataliebock/Bock-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/basic_streamlit_app) üêß 
- The first Streamlit app I've created looks at data on Penguins. Using the interactive sliders and drop-down menu widgets, the user can learn more about the data set and penguins.
- This project complements my portfolio by showing how I can use Streamlit to create interactive apps with a polished look. While it is a simple app, it is a good introductory project.
- **Skills & Packages:** Python, Streamlit, Pandas

### [Machine Learning App](https://github.com/nataliebock/Bock-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/MLStreamlitApp) ‚öôÔ∏è 
- This Streamlit app allows users to use data to evaluate and make predictions through 3 different machine learning models: decision trees, logistic regression, and linear regression.
- This project complements my portfoliio by demonstrating a more complex use of Streamlit, and the application of multiple machine learning models.
- **Skills & Packages:** Python, Streamlit, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit Learn, Graphviz, Machine Learning, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and Linear Regression

### [Unsupervised Machine Learning App](https://github.com/nataliebock/Bock-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/MLUnsupervisedApp)üí° 
- This Streamlit app encourages users to explore data through the use of 3 different unsupervised machine learning models: K-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, and principal component analysis.
- This project complements my portfolio by continuing to demonstrate a more complex use of Streamlit, and an understanding of unsupervised machine learning models.

## Data Cleaning Projects: 
### [Olympics Tidy Data Project](https://github.com/nataliebock/Bock-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/TidyData-Project) ü•á 
- This project uses the principles of tidy data to clean a dataset containing information about the 2008 Summer Olympics. The cleaned data is then used for analysis and visualization.
- To learn more about the tidy data principles and view the project, click the link above or open the TidyData-Project folder within this repository!
- This project complements my coding portfolio by showcasing how I can apply the principles of tidy data to clean a messy dataset and prepare it for analysis. The project also showcases some visualizations, demonstrating how visualizing data is an important part of understanding and evaluating information.
- **Skills & Packages :** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, data cleaning, and data visualization.

## Visualizations üì∏ 
- **An example from the [Unsupervised Machine Learning App](https://github.com/nataliebock/Bock-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/MLUnsupervisedApp) of the K-Means Clustering visualization created using PCA for dimensionality reduction. In this example, the user selected 9 clusters**
